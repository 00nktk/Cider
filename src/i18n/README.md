# Cider i18n
Some notes about Cider's i18n support.
* Localization files are stored in jsonc format aka "JSON with Comments"
* The default language is English.
* The default language is used for messages that are not translated.
* Try when possible to keep the messages the similar in length to the English ones.
* Most of the strings in the content area are provided and translated by Apple themselves, and do not need to be translated.
  * The language Apple Music uses are dependent on the storefront region.
